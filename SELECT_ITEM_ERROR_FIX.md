# SelectItem Error Fix

## üêõ **Error Fixed**

### **Problem:**
```
Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.
```

### **Root Cause:**
In `components/CalendlyBookingFlow.tsx`, there was a `SelectItem` component with an empty string value:

```tsx
<SelectItem value="" disabled className="dashboard-dropdown-item">
  No payment methods available
</SelectItem>
```

### **Solution:**
Changed the empty string value to a non-empty string:

```tsx
<SelectItem value="no-methods" disabled className="dashboard-dropdown-item">
  No payment methods available
</SelectItem>
```

### **Why This Fixes It:**
- React Select components don't allow empty string values for `SelectItem`
- Empty strings are reserved for clearing selections and showing placeholders
- Using `"no-methods"` as the value maintains the disabled state while avoiding the error

### **Files Modified:**
- `components/CalendlyBookingFlow.tsx` - Line 790

### **Testing:**
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes
- ‚úÖ Server runs without errors
- ‚úÖ No more SelectItem validation errors

### **Impact:**
- Fixes the React error that was causing the ErrorBoundary to catch exceptions
- Improves user experience by eliminating console errors
- Maintains the same functionality (disabled option when no payment methods available)
